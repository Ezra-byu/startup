# startup
CS 260
I added HTML pages for each component of your application, with links in the page menus.
I added application textual content via text boxes and content.
I added placeholders for 3rd party content on the Choose Character page (for character selection function) and the Play page (for playing function, which may remain as a place holder depending on how far I get)

I kept the Login placeholder, including user name display.
