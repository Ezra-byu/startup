### Elevator pitch
>This is a fun multiplayer real time strategy game. Play with your friends and experience a sense of combat driven excitement. Each character plays as one member of an adventuring company, each with special abilities. They must all cooperate and use their different abilities to succeed and vanquish evil from the kingdom.

### HTML deliverable
- I added HTML pages for each component of your application, with links in the page menus.
- I added application textual content via text boxes and content.
- I added placeholders for 3rd party content on the Choose Character page (for character selection function) and the Play page (for playing function, which may remain as a place holder depending on how far I get)
- I added application images, in this case pictures of birds as placeholders
- I kept the Login placeholder, including user name display.
- The database placeholder exists as functions of the character selection buttons
- The websocket placeholder is the Websocket data for player staging (seeing which characters are requesting an open game and putting them together) which would run behind the scenes on the Hints page
